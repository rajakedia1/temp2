		    <p>The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) has been studied with much interest within the last three to four decades. The majority of these works focus on the static and deterministic cases of vehicle routing in which all information is known at the time of the planning of the routes. In most real life applications though, stochastic and/or dynamic information occurs parallel to the routes being carried out.</p>
